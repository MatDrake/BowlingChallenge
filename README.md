----------

Running the application will prompt you to input the amount of pins you knocked down for each roll. This needs to be entered as a number between 0 - 10. You will be told which roll of which set you are entering the score for and you total score will be displayed each time you enter a new roll.

Work in Progress:

Currently the input is not conditioned to only accept numbers between 0 - 10 and errors can be thrown from the application not working as intended if something else is entered. It is intended for this to be resolved in the next update.
