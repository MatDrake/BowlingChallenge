----------

The program files are saved within the folder BowlingGame and the tests are contained within BowlingGameTests.

There are three classes of:
- BowlingGame
- BowlingScore
- BowlingSets
- BowlingDisplay

BowlingGame contains the main method that runs on launch, with BowlingSets managing the input and text output of the program, BowlingDisplay outputting a display of each frame and BowlingScore handling the calculations. 

Running the application will prompt you to input the amount of pins you knocked down for each roll. This needs to be entered as a number between 0 - 10. You will be told which roll of which set you are entering the score for and your total score will be displayed, along with a display of your frames, each time you enter a new roll.
